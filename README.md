# Sup. I’m Safiullah Khan.

Not chasing titles. Not chasing trends.  
I break things. I fix them. I learn fast. Repeat.

## What I Do

- Self-taught cybersecurity — no bootcamps, no cert-flexing  
- Daily labs: TryHackMe, HackTheBox, exploit dev, cloud attacks  
- Python scripts that automate boring stuff and expose weaknesses  
- Deep Linux guy — config, defense, offense  
- GitHub is my notebook, not my portfolio

---

## Stack & Tools

- Python, Bash, PowerShell (when I have to)  
- Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit  
- Linux (Arch, Kali, Debian — whatever works)  
- Git, GitHub, VS Code  
- Cloud basics — AWS, working toward hardening & red teaming

---

## Mentality

- I don’t wait to be told what to learn  
- I don’t care about status — I care about skills  
- I don’t need permission to build  
- I don’t follow tutorials blindly — I reverse them
